(a)	LIMITED WARRANTY.  MDM warrants that, for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of delivery (as evidenced by a copy of your receipt): (i) when used with a recommended hardware configuration, the Software will perform in substantial conformance with the documentation supplied with the Software; and (ii) the physical media on which the Software is furnished will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.

If applicable law implies any warranties with respect to the software, all such warranties are limited in duration to ninety (90) days from the date of delivery. No oral or written information or advice given by MDM, its dealers, distributors, agents or employees shall create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of this warranty.
(C)	(USA only) some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other legal rights that vary from state to state.

7.  Exclusive Remedy

Your exclusive remedy under Section 6 is to return the Software to the place you acquired it, with a copy of your receipt and a description of the problem.
