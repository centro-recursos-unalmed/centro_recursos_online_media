It was a funny thing to happen <Dropdown default-text="Choose"><Score num="1" /><Choice>in</Choice><Choice>on</Choice><Choice is-correct="1">out</Choice></Dropdown> of the blue, as he had been listening to Joel’s music that morning. Interviewers reported Joel to be a man of <Dropdown default-text="Choose"><Score num="1" /><Choice>little</Choice><Choice is-correct="1">few</Choice><Choice>no</Choice></Dropdown> words, despite often being <Dropdown default-text="Choose"><Score num="1" /><Choice>on</Choice><Choice>of</Choice><Choice is-correct="1">in</Choice></Dropdown> the public eye for his colourful love life! Anyway, if he approached him, what would Adam say? The fact that Adam had read that Joel had passed all his music exams with <Dropdown default-text="Choose"><Score num="1" /><Choice>soaring</Choice><Choice>rising</Choice><Choice is-correct="1">flying</Choice></Dropdown> colours at the tender age of nine? Or that Joel had stood <Dropdown default-text="Choose"><Score num="1" /><Choice>solid</Choice><Choice>sturdy</Choice><Choice is-correct="1">firm</Choice></Dropdown> on his controversial views? Or even that he had read that Joel was <Dropdown default-text="Choose"><Score num="1" /><Choice>frightened</Choice><Choice>terrified</Choice><Choice is-correct="1">scared</Choice></Dropdown> stiff of getting a bad reaction from an audience? Adam decided not to miss this chance, so he approached Joel and asked him what his advice to any musician would be:<br />‘Always <Dropdown default-text="Choose"><Score num="1" /><Choice is-correct="1">give</Choice><Choice>donate</Choice><Choice>contribute</Choice></Dropdown> one hundred per cent in whatever you do. Stand up to your critics, and you’ll always have the <Dropdown default-text="Choose"><Score num="1" /><Choice>first</Choice><Choice>middle</Choice><Choice is-correct="1">last</Choice></Dropdown> laugh!’<br />Then he added a final tip: ‘Make sure you keep the audience interested and involved.
