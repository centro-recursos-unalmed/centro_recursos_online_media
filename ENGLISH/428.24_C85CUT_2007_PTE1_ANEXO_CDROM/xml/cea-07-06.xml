It was difficult trying to suggest interesting things to do on holiday with Sarah as she had such a <Gap><Score num="1" />negative</Gap>             attitude towards everything.<br />2. All our team members were rather quiet and we needed someone <Gap><Score num="1" />chatty</Gap> and outward going to liven things        up.<br />3. Jenny worked with Laura for five years, but she <Gap><Score num="1" />kept</Gap> herself to herself and Jenny knew very little about her.<br />4. Emily is rather <Gap><Score num="1" />grumpy</Gap> and irritable in the mornings. She’s better once she’s had a strong cup of coffee!<br />5. Angeline is a great person to go travelling with as she’s so <Gap><Score num="1" />laid-back</Gap> and never worries about anything.<br />6. Nothing is ever out of place on Lisa’s desk. It’s always very <Gap><Score num="1" />neat</Gap> and tidy.<br />7. Bill’s office has papers, coffee cups and files all over the place. He is really <Gap><Score num="1" />messy</Gap>.<br />8. Nika is a very <Gap><Score num="1" />dynamic</Gap> character. She always gets things going, be it organising a night out or suggesting             something interesting to do.<br />9. Joe never loses his temper, but you can tell when he’s cross, as he goes quiet and <Gap><Score num="1" />sulks</Gap>.<br />10. I find Cameron very annoying as he doesn’t like listening to other people’s points of views and <Gap><Score num="1" />likes</Gap> to            have things his way. </Question></Content></GapFillDragDrop><Feedback playallOn="1" showAnswersOn="1" animatedFeedbackOn="1" testModeOn="0" instantFeedbackOn="0"><Sounds /></Feedback><GenericActivity hintsNextTo="0" timerIsOn="0" CDPrefsFolder="xml/" CDPrefsFile="cd.xml"><ActivityCanvas graphicAlpha="100" folder="" file="" colourAlpha="100" colour="transparent" /><SoundLibrary y="10" x="10" isOn="0" /><VideoLibrary h="264.95" w="385" y="75.05" x="10" isOn="0" /><Assets /></GenericActivity></Activity></Entry></CD-RAT>
