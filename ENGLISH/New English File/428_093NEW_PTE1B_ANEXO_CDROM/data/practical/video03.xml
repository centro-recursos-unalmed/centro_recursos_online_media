  <line number="1" name="Anthony">Well, in a sense yes. But only, you know, in terms of gliding or a bit of climbing. Doing things that you shouldn't be doing. I think in Belgium once, I decided to go up a cliff face and it said 'Do not go up the cliff face! Follow the path!' You know, and it was a bit hairy: loose pebbles and, you know, possibilities of causing an avalanche further down, but you know, sometimes you've got to take risks.
I've thought about possibly bungee jumping, it's not particularly high-risk, but gosh I saw someone do a bungee jump and they went flat on the ground. But that was just in the movies. </line> 
  <line number="2" name="Jane">Yes, I've white-water rafted on the Zambezi. That was very scary. I shan't be doing it again.</line> 
  <line number="3" name="Louise">I don't know, I've been on like roller coasters and done a bungee jump. It's like the feeling of flying. Absolutely loved it, you can't get anything like that in the world, to be fair.
Probably white-water rafting, I'd love to try that because I do love water, I love swimming.</line> 
  <line number="4" name="Jae Wan">Yeah, I do a lot of high-risk sports, I do downhill mountain-biking - that's how I got this, I broke my shoulder. And yeah, I do a lot of BMX freestyle and everything else.</line>
