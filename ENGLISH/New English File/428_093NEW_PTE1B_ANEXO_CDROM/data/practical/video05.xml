  <line number="1" name="Miles">Yes, several, yes. I've been to Reading and Glastonbury, I can't remember the others, but there have been some other smaller ones as well, a few years ago.
They were excellent yeah, what I remember. They were good, very good.</line> 
  <line number="2" name="Theresa">I've been to see Tina Turner at Wembley who was absolutely fantastic, she has so much energy and vitality - it's incredible. And I've also seen Status Quo, so I'm quite into kind of rock.</line> 
  <line number="3" name="Louise">Yes, I've been to Reading and to Download.
Mad, mad, just staying up all night listening to music with all your friends, having a few beverages, and just having a good time. Very fun!</line> 
  <line number="4" name="Anthony">Yes.
Well, years ago when it was a free and open thing, I used to go down to Stonehenge, which was pretty wild I have to say, and I think what I recall then, bikers, Hell's Angels, and all sorts of others, doing security, police didn't want to know. Aside from that, Led Zeppelin at Knebworth Park, you know, a few things like that.</line>
