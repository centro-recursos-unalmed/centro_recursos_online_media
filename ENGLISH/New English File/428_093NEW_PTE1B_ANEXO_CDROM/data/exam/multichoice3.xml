	<para><![CDATA[Fred Burrows has made some major changes in his life. He realized that it is [*up:on:for:over] to individuals, not just companies and governments to [make:act:take:*do] something about climate change. 'I [had:*took:arrived:thought] the decision that I was going to make my life as green as I possibly could,' he said. He started with transport 'I don't fly [still:yet:*any more:more] and I use my bike for short journeys. If I need to go longer distances, then I [trip:voyage:*travel:journey] by train.' Fred also only eats local food, organic when he can. He also [matures:*grows:makes:does] a lot of his own vegetables, and keeps chickens and goats for eggs and milk. 'There are [*likely:probably:possibly:certainly] to be food shortages in the future and I want to be able to provide for [ourselves:I:*myself:us] and my family. We can't [continue:*carry:further:proceed] on living the way we do, if we want the world to survive, we [ought:got:have:*must] all make some sacrifices.']]></para>
