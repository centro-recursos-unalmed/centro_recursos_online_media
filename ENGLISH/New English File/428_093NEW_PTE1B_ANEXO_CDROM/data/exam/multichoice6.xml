<title>Hangul</title>
	<para><![CDATA[Hangul, the Korean alphabet, is said to be the [*only:alone:unique:lonely] written script that was designed by one man. [*Around:Near:Close:Soon] the year 1443 King Sejong completed the project of creating the alphabet in order to replace the script based on Chinese characters, which was being used in Korea at the time. We are not sure to what extent King Sejong [imagined:designed:conceived:*thought] up the alphabet himself or whether he was helped by a [gang:*team:company:side] of advisers. The King decided that Chinese writing was not suitable for the Korean language and that it was [much:very:*too:so] complicated for common people to learn. Hangul is made up of letters, [nominated:*known:designated:called] as 'Jamo', that represent sounds, [as:same:similar:*like] the Latin alphabet. The 'Jamo' are grouped [one:along:*together:united] in syllables. Hangul can be written [whether:*either:both:or] vertically or horizontally. It is supposedly [*so:really:very:even] easy to learn that a wise person could learn it in a morning.]]></para>
