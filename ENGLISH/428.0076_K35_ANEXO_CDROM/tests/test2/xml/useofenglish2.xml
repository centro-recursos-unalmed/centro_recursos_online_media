	<text><![CDATA[Design is everywhere. It's what attracted you to the last car or piece of furniture you bought and it's what <gap>1</gap> on-line banking possible. It means that London taxis are easier to get in and out of and that Stella McCartney is a household name. Design is driving whole business cultures forward as well as making sure that it's easier to find your way around places <gap>2</gap> hospitals and airports.<p></p>The single word 'design' encompasses an awful lot, and that's why the search for a single definition <gap>3</gap> to lengthy debate to say the least. There are broad definitions and specific ones – both have <gap>4</gap>. Either they're too general to be meaningful or they <gap>5</gap> too much.<p></p>One definition, <gap>6</gap> by designer Richard Seymour, is 'making things better for people'. It emphasises that design activity is mostly <gap>7</gap> with human behaviour and quality of life. But nurses or road sweepers could be <gap>8</gap> in saying that they, too, 'make things better for people'.<p></p>Meanwhile, an alternative definition that <gap>9</gap> on products or 3D realisations of ideas doesn't include the work of graphic designers, service designers and many other disciplines. There may be no <gap>10</gap> definition of design that will please everyone, but attempting to find one does help us to <gap>11</gap> down the unique set of skills that designers<p></p><gap>12</gap> to the world.

		<text><![CDATA[<p></p><p></p>I know it's unfashionable to say so, but I find exercise tedious and unrewarding. I'm not particularly fit and I don't <gap>go</gap> in for pavement pounding and other exertions, but <gap>neither|nor</gap> am I a complete slob. I enjoy a good walk, for example. It's just that I find exercise <gap>for</gap> exercise's sake pointless. I'm someone <gap>who</gap> feels a lot 'better' when I'm not pushing myself <gap>to</gap> the limit. I take moderate exercise, but never exert myself in the sustained sort of way that requires special equipment.<p></p>Gyms attract people with promises of leaner bodies, and take large membership fees in the full knowledge <gap>that</gap> most people won't <gap>be</gap> able to endure the boredom involved in pumping iron week in week <gap>out</gap>. I lasted six, and hated every moment of it.<p></p>A few years later, I tried an altogether cheaper activity; running. I was assured I'd feel <gap>like</gap> a different person. I did it for a year and reaped <gap>no</gap> real benefits at all. My body didn't change, <gap>with</gap> the possible exception of my knee joints, <gap>which</gap> complained bitterly. By the sixth month, each 45 minute run had become less agonising, but it was never <gap>what</gap> you'd call enjoyable. On a walk that summer, I strode up a steep hill leaving my friends trailing behind and <gap>in</gap> doing so proved I was fit. That felt good, but a whole year of running for that brief moment of satisfaction – it just wasn't <gap>worth</gap> it.

		<text><![CDATA[<p></p><p></p>A German architect called Werner Aisslinger thinks he has found the solution to the lack of living space in the world's overcrowded cities. 'Loftcubes' are portable flats that can be airlifted onto any <gap>unused</gap> flat roof by helicopter. The 36 square-metre structures are effectively mobile living <gap>containers</gap> which each have a bathroom, a kitchen and a large living area that can be partitioned into smaller sections by the <gap>addition</gap> of sliding panels. The loftcube is <gap>primarily</gap> aimed at young professionals, who often need to <gap>relocate</gap> from one city to another as their careers develop. Often it's difficult for them to find <gap>affordable</gap> accommodation at short notice.<p></p><gap>Occupants|Occupiers</gap> of loftcubes would have the option of taking their home with them, as they are light enough to be airlifted by helicopter. There are certain details to be worked out at each site, such as making <gap>arrangements</gap> for water supply and heating, but it most cases it should be possible to tap into the building's <gap>existing</gap> supplies, and the potential for harnessing solar energy is great. Loftcubes are expected to cost a great deal less to buy than <gap>traditional</gap> one-roomed flats in most European cities, bringing them within the reach of young single people.]]></text>
