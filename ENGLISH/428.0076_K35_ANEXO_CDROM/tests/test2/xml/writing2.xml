				<text><![CDATA[Dear Pedro,<p></p>Could you write a short report on the course last month? I’m considering sending others, so I’d like to know what you did and whether you would recommend it.<p></p>Thank you,<p></p>Janice<p></p><p></p><I>Wish we were a smaller group – I’ve got so many questions about the theory. Good idea to have theory first, though.<p></p><p></p>So tired – everyday packed with seminars. Useful activities putting theory into practice, though.<p></p><p></p>Great handouts! No time to read them now.<p></p><p></p>Never thought like this before – I’ll be much more efficient in future.<p></p><p></p>Really glad I did this!</I><p></p><p></p>Now write your <b>report</b> for your manager.]]></text>
				<sampleAnswer><![CDATA[This is a report on the time management training course I attended from July 7–10th .<p></p><b>The course</b><p></p>The course consisted of daily seminars with a great deal of theoretical input, followed by related practical activities. There was a large amount of information provided, both in the seminars and in handouts that were provided after every session.<p></p><b>Assessment of the course</b><p></p>The seminars and activities were useful, although the groups were too large. This meant that we were not able to ask individual questions, and there was little sense of personal involvement. In fact there was too much information and it was impossible to keep up with the reading. It was also extremely tiring. On balance, however, it was stimulating and made me reassess the way I manage my time. Personally, I felt it was a productive and useful experience.<p></p><b>Recommendations</b><p></p>I would recommend this course for colleagues, and feel that it would improve the efficiency of the department. I would recommend the following.<p></p><b>.</b>	colleagues should read copies of the handouts before the course, to prepare themselves for the theory input sessions<p></p><b>.</b>	colleagues should prepare any questions they might have beforehand, and meet seminar leaders in the breaks to discuss them<p></p><b>Conclusion</b><p></p>This was a useful course, and I would definitely recommend it for others in the department.]]></sampleAnswer>

				<sampleAnswer ref="2"><![CDATA[Have you ever swung across a gorge on a huge elastic swing? Or climbed to the top of a cliff through trees and exotic vegetation? Well, I have done both, and they were fantastic!<p></p><p></p>It was last year that I went on an adventure holiday to South America. I went with a group of students, and for the first two weeks of the trip, we back-packed through forests and camped out by beautiful lakes. We cooked our own food, and spent our evenings telling stories and singing songs. We had not known each other before, but one of the best things about the experience was the really good friends that I made then – we all got on really well together.<p></p><p></p>So are you impressed? Well, that was pretty amazing, but there was an even better experience to come! In the last week we went to a gorge where there was an adventure camp set up. We were given special equipment, and taught how to climb the face of a really high cliff. I was scared at first, but got the hang of it and really enjoyed it. But the icing on the cake was the bungey jump! After we had all reached the top of the cliff there was a crane with an elastic rope attached and we all jumped off the edge of the cliff into space! I felt as though I could fly!<p></p><p></p>So that was my exciting and unusual holiday, and I just can’t wait to find something equally thrilling to do next year.]]></sampleAnswer>

				<questionText><![CDATA[You have been asked to write part of an information sheet giving advice to new students about the best way to start college life. Your section should include advice on finding suitable accommodation, methods of study and ways of meeting people.]]></questionText>
				<footerText><![CDATA[Write your section of the <b>information sheet</b>.]]></footerText>
				</text>
				<sampleAnswer ref="3"><![CDATA[<b>Accommodation</b><p></p><p></p>When you plan college life, one priority is finding suitable accommodation. You can<p></p><p></p>1. rent a room in a block of student flats. This is good for anyone who enjoys socialising and being part of a community, but it can be noisy.<p></p><p></p>2. rent a room in a house. This is fine if you want a quieter life, but you will have to make more of an effort to meet other students.<p></p><p></p>Which ever option you choose, the university accommodation office will arrange it – but make sure that you decide well in advance. The best rooms are taken very quickly!<p></p><p></p><b>Ways of studying</b><p></p><p></p>People study in different ways, and you must choose the best way for you. You will be given a timetable for your lectures and seminars, but you must organise your free time study for yourself. Think about<p></p><p></p>· where to study – in the library, in your room, with friends<p></p><p></p>· how long to study – of course you must complete all your assignments, but you should set aside the best time to do this. Some people work at night, others in the morning. Give yourself<p></p>breaks, but meet all your deadlines. There is nothing worse<p></p>than missing a deadline and have too much work to make up.<p></p><p></p><b>Meeting people</b><p></p><p></p>College is a fantastic place to meet people. Make sure that you check the social activities sheet which is displayed every week outside the library. Try things that you’ve never done before – join clubs, do new sports – you’ll be amazed how many friends you make.]]></sampleAnswer>

				<sampleAnswer ref="4"><![CDATA[The last film I saw was the latest James Bond movie, 'Casino Royale'. Before the film came out, there was a lot of hype about the new actor playing James Bond, Daniel Craig – would the public be prepared to accept a new Bond with fair hair?  Craig has answered his critics in this fine performance.<p></p><p></p>The film tells the story of the very first Fleming novel, and the action takes place in the present day. Bond, however, is young and starting out on his career as an oo agent. He makes a mess of his mission, and is punished by M. Predictably, Bond then goes off on his own without permission to try to sort things out and after many exciting sequences he ends up in a casino gambling for very high stakes.<p></p><p></p>As with most Bond films, the story is far-fetched and the plot is full of unlikely twists and turns. As always, the action is more important than the plot. In contrast to other Bonds, Craig is more intense and serious and although there are moments of humour ‘Casino Royale’  is not as light-hearted as previous films. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it, because of Craig’s acting and because of his new approach to the Bond character.<p></p><p></p>Would I recommend this film wholeheartedly? I would not recommend it for children, as there are some violent scenes that could be disturbing. I would, however, recommend it for any die-hard Bond fan. It is exciting and thought-provoking, and although darker than previous films it provides an enjoyable night out.]]></sampleAnswer>
