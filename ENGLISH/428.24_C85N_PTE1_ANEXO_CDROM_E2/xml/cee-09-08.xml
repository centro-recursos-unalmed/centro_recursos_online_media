Well, I <Gap><Score num="1" />went</Gap> shopping in town. First I went to the <Gap><Score num="1" />pharmacy</Gap> and I bought a new toothbrush and some <Gap><Score num="1" />toothpaste</Gap>. I also got some <Gap><Score num="1" />medicine</Gap> for Jack. He’s got a bad cold. Then I <Gap><Score num="1" />took</Gap> some <Gap><Score num="1" />dirty</Gap> clothes to the dry-cleaners. After that I wanted to get a <Gap><Score num="1" />present</Gap> for Greta. You know it’s her birthday on Wednesday. I tried Annabel’s, you know, that little gift shop on Maze Lane and I <Gap><Score num="1" />bought</Gap> her a nice diary. So then I ran to the post office and <Gap><Score num="1" />posted</Gap> it. It was<br />1 o’clock by then and I <Gap><Score num="1" />had</Gap> lunch in Peaches. Then I went to the hairdresser’s to have a <Gap><Score num="1" />haircut</Gap>. Do you like it? And then I <Gap><Score num="1" />came</Gap> home. So that’s my day. What about you?</Question></Content></GapFillInput><Feedback playallOn="1" showAnswersOn="1" animatedFeedbackOn="1" testModeOn="0" instantFeedbackOn="0"><Sounds /></Feedback><GenericActivity hintsNextTo="0" timerIsOn="0" CDPrefsFolder="xml/" CDPrefsFile="cd.xml"><ActivityCanvas graphicAlpha="100" folder="" file="" colourAlpha="100" colour="transparent" /><SoundLibrary y="10" x="10" isOn="0" /><VideoLibrary h="252" w="385" y="78" x="10" isOn="0" /><Assets /></GenericActivity></Activity></Entry></CD-RAT>
