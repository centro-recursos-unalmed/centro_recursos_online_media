<title> Imaginary situations in the past with &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;</title>
<sectiontitle>We use &lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; + Past perfect to describe an imaginary situation in the past. We use &lt;i&gt;would/could/might + have&lt;/i&gt; + past participle to describe an imaginary result in the past. This is often called the 'Third conditional'.</sectiontitle>
