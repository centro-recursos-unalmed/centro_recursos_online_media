Jeff Aldridge and his friend Will Foster were on the fifth day of a ten-day walk in Oregon. Jeff was trying to climb a rock when he fell and broke his leg. At that point, the two young men were about seventy kilometres from the nearest town. Will used his mobile phone to try and call the local emergency services but wasn’t able to get an answer. So he built a fire for Jeff and climbed a nearby hill from where he phoned his mother in Manchester, almost 8000 kilometres away.  </FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="12" COLOR="#000000">Fortunately, Will’s mother was at home but at first she didn’t believe it was him. Eventually, he convinced her and within minutes, she had contacted her local police, who phoned the emergency services in Seattle. A helicopter was immediately sent out to search for the injured man. By now, it had begun to get dark and Jeff was getting worse. Fortunately, the helicopter pilot saw the fire and landed in a nearby field. They took Jeff and Will off to the local hospital, where Jeff is now recovering well. </FONT></P></Asset></ReferenceObject><ScrollableAssets /><Content><Question>1.
