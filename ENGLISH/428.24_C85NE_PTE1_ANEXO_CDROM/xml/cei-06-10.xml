And <Gap><Score num="1" />are we getting tired of</Gap> so-called ‘Reality TV’? I went out and asked some members of the public.    <LineBreak size="13" /><br />Aneefa<br />I think what reality TV is … is where ordinary people are put into situations where they have every aspect of their life filmed and I think <Gap><Score num="1" />my biggest problem with that is</Gap> the invasion of privacy, <Gap><Score num="1" />the fact that</Gap> you no longer have a private life.    <LineBreak size="13" /><br />David<br /><Gap><Score num="1" />I think it&apos;s just fantastic to see</Gap> ordinary people on TV. Their lives are so much more interesting than celebrities. You know, <Gap><Score num="1" />it&apos;s great hearing</Gap> the opinions of people on Big Brother, knowing <Gap><Score num="1" />what they think about things</Gap> and what they think about the world. I think it’s just fantastic.    <LineBreak size="13" /><br />Jennifer<br />I don’t like reality TV shows <Gap><Score num="1" />very much</Gap>. Sometimes I find myself watching them <Gap><Score num="1" />even though I don&apos;t want to</Gap> but I like reality TV shows that have <Gap><Score num="1" />a theme</Gap>, like people who are all hairdressers or models or farmers or some thing <Gap><Score num="1" />that ties them all together</Gap>. When it’s just ordinary people being ordinary people <Gap><Score num="1" />it&apos;s less exciting</Gap>, I think.     <LineBreak size="13" /><br />Graham<br />I think reality TV is a really strange thing. I <Gap><Score num="1" />don&apos;t like it at all</Gap> and I certainly <Gap><Score num="1" />would never watch</Gap> that kind of programme. I just think <Gap><Score num="1" />it&apos;s an excuse for people to</Gap> go on TV and then for everyone to talk about them <Gap><Score num="1" />rather than actually doing</Gap> something with their own lives.    <LineBreak size="13" /><br />Sarahjane<br />I don’t watch TV at all. <Gap><Score num="1" />I find it boring</Gap> … not boring … it’s … I find people more interesting so I don’t watch television <Gap><Score num="1" />at all</Gap>.</Question></Content></GapFillInput><Feedback playallOn="1" showAnswersOn="1" animatedFeedbackOn="1" testModeOn="0" instantFeedbackOn="0"><Sounds /></Feedback><GenericActivity hintsNextTo="0" timerIsOn="0" CDPrefsFolder="preferences/" CDPrefsFile="cd.xml"><ActivityCanvas graphicAlpha="100" folder="" file="" colourAlpha="100" colour="transparent" /><SoundLibrary y="10" x="10" isOn="0" /><VideoLibrary h="240" w="320" y="76" x="8" layer="2" isOn="1"><Item bDefault="1" endTime="135.44" startTime="0" duration="135.44" id="1" file="Int_06.flv" folder="video/" /></VideoLibrary><Assets /></GenericActivity></Activity></Entry></CD-RAT>
